I think]]></title><description><![CDATA[<h3 id="oksoletsdothis">Ok, so lets do this</h3>

<p>Hey, so I am trying something new, I am actually hoping that I will maintain a blog with some bits and bobs on it that I see and do, make and find, or whatever, I am going to do this with Ghost running on my Mac Book, then using Buster to deploy the flat version of the site to GitHub Pages - what this should allow is for a pretty robust and secure site, without much potential for things to go horribly wrong... famous last words, but we'll see.</p>

<p>If I manage to keep this up for any length of time, I might actually go to the trouble of sorting out a proper domain for it, but lets not get ahead of ourselves shall we? </p>

<p>I just thought I would put a photo of my buddy Chris Jackson scoring a diving touchdown that I took the other day against South Wales Warriors, its not really relevant but damn son, I so often miss the action that when I don't I have to share the wealth!</p>

<p>Till next time...</p>]]></description><link>http://charlesgreig.github.io/testing/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">82dfdb72-6a65-4cdb-9345-8521b81deeec</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Charles Greig]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2014 22:39:07 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
